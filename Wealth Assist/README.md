## Setup Instructions

1. **Basic Setup**:
   - Clone or download this repository
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the landing page

2. **Customization**:
   - Replace placeholder content with actual Wealth Assist content
   - Create and add a favicon.png file to the assets directory
   - Replace the placeholder Rive animation with a real .riv file

3. **Advanced Customization**:
   - Create a Spline 3D scene and update the Spline viewer URL in index.html
   - Modify colors in styles.css to match brand guidelines
   - Add additional sections or features as needed

## Animation Technologies

This landing page uses several animation technologies:

1. **Rive**: For vector animations. Replace the placeholder file with a real .riv animation created at [rive.app](https://rive.app/).

2. **Framer Motion**: For physics-based animations and transitions. The library is already included via CDN.

3. **Spline**: For 3D elements. Create a scene at [spline.design](https://spline.design/) and update the URL in the HTML.

## Browser Compatibility

This landing page is compatible with:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

Some effects like backdrop-filter (used for glassmorphism) may not work in older browsers.

## Performance Considerations

- Large 3D scenes from Spline may impact performance on lower-end devices
- Consider creating fallbacks for animations on mobile devices
- Optimize images and assets for production use
