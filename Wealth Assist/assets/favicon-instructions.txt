FAVICON INSTRUCTIONS

To complete the website, please create a favicon.png file and place it in the assets directory.

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 32x32 pixels or 64x64 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Design: Use the Wealth Assist logo or a simplified version
- Colors: Use the brand colors (cyan #00d4ff and magenta #ff007a)

Once created, the favicon will automatically be used by the website as it's already linked in the HTML head:
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="assets/favicon.png">

Alternative formats like .ico can also be used by changing the link tag in index.html.
